# CMSI-282-Algorithms

Selected programs from Loyola Marymount University's Algorithms CMSI-282 course.

- **DominoSolver.java**: Given a valid sequence of dominoes taken in as arguments, it gives the maximum possible reward for collapsing the sequence to a single domino.
- **PowerSolver.java**: Contains several problems involving:
    - Raising x to the power n, for some arbitrary values of x and n.
    - Polynomial evaluation using Horner's Rule.
    - Finding greatest common divisors using Euclid's algorithm.
    - Finding least common multiples using the technique discussed at class.
- **SchoolgirlSolver.java**: Outputs a single solution to Kirkman's schoolgirl problem, in collaboration with [Donovan Moini](https://github.com/dmoini).
- **RootFinder.java**: Returns the square root of x with a specified precision.
